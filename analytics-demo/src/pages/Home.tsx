                Once there was a magical elf who lived in a rainbow tree.<br />
                He lived downstairs from a flatulent dwarf who was constantly having to pee.<br />
                One day, the elf could take no more<br />
                so he went to bang on the rude dwarf's door<br />
                And what do you know, they suddenly both were married.
