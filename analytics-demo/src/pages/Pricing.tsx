                With bony hands I hold my partner<br />
                on soulless feet we cross the floor<br />
                the music stops as if to answer<br />
                an empty knocking at the door.<br />
                <br />
                it seems his skin was sweet as mango<br />
                when last I held him to my breast<br />
                but now, we dance this grim fandango<br />
                and will for years until we rest.
